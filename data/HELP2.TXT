 FOR EACH CIRCUIT, ARRANGE THE
 TOKENS TO FORM A CONTINUOUS
 PATHWAY FROM VCC TO GND THAT
 LIGHTS UP THE DESIGNATED LEDS.

 ALL TOKENS MUST BE USED, AND
 THERE CAN BE NO LOOSE ENDS,
 EXCEPT ON THE SWITCH AND GND
 TOKENS. THERE IS A BUILTJIN
 RULE CHECKER TO HELP.

 THE NORMAL RULES OF ELECTRICAL
 CURRENT AND LEDS APPLY. AVOID
 CREATING SHORT CIRCUITS.
