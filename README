Background

The Uzebox is a retro-minimalist homebrew game console, created in
2008 by Alec Bourque. It is based on an AVR 8-bit general purpose
microcontroller made by Atmel. The microcontroller is overclocked to
run at 28.61818 MHz, and only has a total of 4 KB of RAM, and 64 KB of
program memory.

About Circuit Puzzle

Circuit Puzzle is a Uzebox implementation of an electricity-based
puzzle game. Gameplay is similar to both of my Laser Puzzle games, but
with many improvements to the user interface.

It has 60 levels, divided up into the following skill levels:
Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert.

For each circuit, arrange the tokens to form a continuous pathway from
VCC to GND that lights up the designated LEDs. All tokens must be
used, and there can be no loose ends, except on the SWITCH and GND
tokens. There is a built-in rule checker to help. The normal rules of
electrical current and LEDs apply. Avoid creating short circuits.

Play Circuit Puzzle

If you don't have a Uzebox video game console, you can play it using
an online Uzebox emulator: https://artcfox.github.io/circuit/

Using a keyboard is preferred, but the touch controls should allow you
to at least preview the gameplay if you are on a mobile device. The
native desktop emulator supports USB SNES game controllers, or you can
build your own Uzebox game console: https://uzebox.org/
